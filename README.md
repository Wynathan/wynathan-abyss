 # [Warriors: Abyss — An Interactive Spreadsheet](https://wynathan.github.io/wynathan-abyss/)

 An interactive spreadsheet helping you plan your builds in **Warriors: Abyss** -- a game developed by **Omega Force** and published by **Koei Tecmo**.

 ### Related Versions:
  - Spreadsheet version: **v0.10.0-beta**, 2025-07-17.
  - Game Version: **Update 4** (**v1.4.1**, 2025-07-11) — Ryu Hayabusa, Ayane, Rachel, Momiji. 
 
 ### Main features of the spreadsheet:
   - list of all **Heroes**;
   - a form allowing you to filter **Heroes** by their **Stat Emblems**, **Element Emblems**, and **Personal Emblems** (all **Emblem** filters use _AND_ logic, meaning the results will have ALL selected **Emblems**);
   - two options allowing you to show **Hero** data when **non-Transcended**, **Transcended**, or **both** simultaneously (accompanied by a **Unique Weapon** and **Transcended** spear icons, respectively);
   - interactive **Emblems** in the table itself, allowing you to filter **Heroes** by **Emblems** you see in every **Hero**'s row;
   - responsive layout for ***mobile*** devices.

 ### Additional features:
   - "**Faction Emblems**": each **Faction Emblem** has a total number of appearances amongst all **Heroes** added to it (changes when choosing either "**Use Transcended**" or "**Use Non-Transcended**", but shows "**Use Transcended**" values when both options are selected);
   - "**Search by Hero name**": search **Heroes** by name, including their names in-game and their names in pinyin (use "_lü_" or "_lv_" for **DW Heroes** like **Lü Bu**);
   - "**Search by Hero name**": search all ladies by typing "_lady_" in the search box (**Ranmaru** is not a lady!);
   - "**Use In-Game Order**": re-order the table to match the order in which **Heroes** are displayed in-game;
   - "**Display In-Game Names**": use the spelling of **Hero** names as displayed in-game (including errors like **Xu Chu** being "_Xu Zhu_");
   - "**Display Row Numbers**": add a simple number in **Hero Name** column in each row for convenience;
   - "**Reset Filters**": reset all filters (**Stat Emblems**, **Element Emblems**, **Faction Emblems**, **Personal Emblems**, **Search by Hero name**);
   - "**Show/Hide Specific Columns**": show/hide specific columns (excluding **Hero Name**).
   - text highlight for **Traits** and **Tactics** similar to that in-game, but more consistent.
